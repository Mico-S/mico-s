Hi! I'm Micah Cook, a developer and blogger. I'm currently based out of Denver and work at [Aclymate](https://aclymate.com) and [Renoster](https://renoster.co) as a founding software engineer. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, meteorology, and basketball.

## About this site

This website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty), a static site generator. It uses Nunjucks templating, Markdown for content, and custom CSS for styling. I push to GitHub, triggering GitHub Actions, which then deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
