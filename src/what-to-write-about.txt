What to write about:
- Things I learned
- Descriptions of my projects
- Things I've found
The value of blogging comes from writing frequently and having something to show for it
over time - even if you don't attract any audience! Basically treat it as a public
journal for yourself with bookmarks and learning concepts.

Tips to write better:
- Get to the point
    Reader tries to answer these questions in title and first few sentences:
    1. Did the author write this article for someone like me?
    2. How will I benefit from reading it?
    Benefits include: 
    - Technique to apply in work/life
    - Clear explanation of concept that impacts work/life
    - Insight that gives reader better understanding of particular thing
    - Interesting story that resonates with the reader

- Think one degree bigger
    Essentially, finds way to expand your article to a larger audience by
    often adding one or two extra sentences to explain a specific topic

- Show more pictures 
    Diagrams, graphs, screenshots to better explain things

- Accommodate skimmers
    Basically, don't just post walls of text. Break it up with images, headers, links, etc
