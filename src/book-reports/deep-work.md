## Part 1: The Idea

### Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

This chapter is about how in work, especially knowledge work, there are great financial and competitive advantages in practicing deep work. Within the marketplace of knowledge workers, there are three groups he identified that will be successful:

- Those who use the latest and greatest tools very well to create great value
- Those who become superstars at a particular skill
- Those who invest in companies and individuals who fall into the previous two categories

Newport acknowledges that most people won't ever fall into the 3rd category, so he focuses on the 1st and 2nd. Personally, I strongly believe deep work in the 1st category makes the most sense.

### Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare

Deep work is becoming more rare as time goes on. This is because our connectivity culture (social media and instant messaging apps) and industrial revolution aged ways of measuring productivity (produce X thing in Y time) don't apply well to knowledge work. As we spend more time investing in forms of shallow work involving constant connectivity and distractions, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the consistent state of focus required for deep work.

### Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful

The most valuable chapter to me, Newport explains how if one truely invests themselves in deep work, nearly any form of work they do will become much more meaningful. This will result in a much deeper feeling of meaning and purpose in life. Knowledge work can go from a distracted and draining obligation into something wondrous and satisfying, as you start to pick up on the depth, details, and nuance in all you do. This reminds me _a lot_ of the ideas that Robert Pirsig makes in _Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, where deeply working on his motorcycle is the gateway to personal satisfaction and meaning in the world, and he encourages the reader to perform deep work in all they do in order to find that meaning.

## Part 2: The Rules

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

Newport starts off talking about the different practices/habits available to perform deep work, and to choose one that makes sense given your circumstances (CEO vs. academic vs. another type of worker).
