## Part 1: The Idea

### Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

This chapter is about how in work, especially knowledge work, there are great financial and competitive advantages in practicing deep work. Within the marketplace of knowledge workers, there are three groups he identified that will be successful:

- Those who use the latest and greatest tools very well to create great value
- Those who become superstars at a particular skill
- Those who invest in companies and individuals who fall into the previous two categories

Newport acknowledges that most people won't ever fall into the 3rd category, so he focuses on the 1st and 2nd. Personally, I strongly believe deep work in the 1st category makes the most sense.

### Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare

Deep work is becoming more rare as time goes on. This is because our connectivity culture (social media and instant messaging apps) and industrial revolution aged ways of measuring productivity (produce X thing in Y time) don't apply well to knowledge work. As we spend more time investing in forms of shallow work involving constant connectivity and distractions, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the consistent state of focus required for deep work.

### Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful

The most valuable chapter to me, Newport explains how if one truely invests themselves in deep work, nearly any form of work they do will become much more meaningful. This will result in a much deeper feeling of meaning and purpose in life. Knowledge work can go from a distracted and draining obligation into something wondrous and satisfying, as you start to pick up on the depth, details, and nuance in all you do. This reminds me _a lot_ of the ideas that Robert Pirsig makes in _Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, where deeply working on his motorcycle is the gateway to personal satisfaction and meaning in the world, and he encourages the reader to perform deep work in all they do in order to find that meaning.

## Part 2: The Rules

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

Newport starts off talking about the different practices/habits available to perform deep work, and to choose one that makes sense given your circumstances (CEO vs. academic vs. another type of worker). He outlines 4 types that he has seen before:

- Monastic deep work: Multi-month/seasonal stretches of deep work
- Bi-modal deep work: In a given week, using 4 days for deep work and 3 for availability
- Ritualistic deep work: In a given day, using set periods of time for deep work (e.g. 5 to 7 am for deep work)
- Journalistic deep work: Fitting in deep work where you can, like an on/off switch

There is no one correct ritual, and you'll need to experiment what works for you, but every effective ritual must address:

- Where you'll work and for how long: usually a quite space and time framed (JK Rowling example of going to a hotel suite for work on Deathly Hallows)
- How you'll work once you start to work: things like bans on internet during the time frame, metrics to keep yourself focused, and what you'll work on in chunks
- How you'll support your work: coffee, proper diet, and walking are things to keep your mind nourished while it's working hard

Newport also talks about the 4DX framework for how to accomplish specific goals with deep work. The key here is to make you more consistent over a long period of time, rather than bunching things around certain times:

1. Focus on a wildly ambitious goal and let that take your mind off of smaller, more superficial things
2. Use lead/lag indicators: essentially, track deep work sessions (lead) and results produced (lag)
3. Do weekly reviews of your progress, see what needs to change or continue

### Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

Having a consistent habit of "shutdown" is also vitally important: at the end of every work day, make it a habit to completely shut off all work related tasks or thinking. You'll need this to allow your unconcious mind to solve more difficult questions that require many considerations. Having a "shutdown habit" at the end of the workday can be valuable. You basically take an extra 10 or 15 minutes post-work to schedule and track what needs to get done and how you'll approach the next day, then have a ritual to leave it all. Using the extra time in the evenings for pleasant low-stimuli activity can be helpful to recoup. For example, walking, having a conversation with a friend, etc. Obviously it doesn't me don't do anything, you can still work on side projects or read things, just don't think of work at all.

Newport also says how it's not necessarily that distracting services makes us more distracted, it's that constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities at the slightest hint of boredom or fatigue or stress causes a lot of damage. Using the internet in blocks or chunks is what he suggests to reduce the urge and addiction of switching - to further train the mind to be deep.
