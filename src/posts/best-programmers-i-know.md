Article: [The Best Programmers I Know](https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/) by Matthias Endler

Here are some traits of the best developers/engineers that Matthias has met or seen. My post on this is more about repeating certain traits that I would like to improve for myself:

#### Know your tools really well

More specifically, knowing the history and limitations of the tools I use is something that doesn't cross my mind very often. A great point to follow through on.

#### Write

Welp, I'm giving that a shot right now! Even if it's brief commentary on things I've found or learned, it's good to reiterate concepts to myself so I can better understand it.

#### Never stop learning

This section is gold, even if it sounds cliche at times. Continuing to foster curiosity and keep asking questions is difficult to do as I get older.

#### Don't be afraid to say "I don't know", but don't stop there

This is more of an extension of the "never stop learning" section, but admitting that you don't know something _then_ asking follow-up questions is the first big step in learning.

The general idea I got from all the sections in this article is staying curious. It's difficult to do, but continuing to be intentionally curious is a skill that takes time, hard work, and consistency.
