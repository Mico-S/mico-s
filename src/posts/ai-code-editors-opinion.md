Article: [Why I stopped using AI code editors](https://lucianonooijen.com/blog/why-i-stopped-using-ai-code-editors) by Luciano Nooijen

I like Luciano's approach with how he prefers to integrate with AI. It reminds me of Simon Willison's approach, where context is manually applied to AI interfaces and outputs are reviewed before applying changes. For me, the biggest takeaway is to stay curious and use AI as a tool to understand what is happening, not just let it write all code for you.
