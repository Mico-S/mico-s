Article: [AI cheats: Why you didn’t notice your teammate was cheating](https://niila.fi/en/ai-cheats/) by Niila Viinamäki

Really cool explanation from Niila on how "colorbot" cheats work in FPS games. Essentially, it's a program that reads enemy positions on the screen from a capture card and can provide a slight aim assist for the cheater. Where AI comes in is that developers can train models to detect those enemy positions on screen, which enhances the program's ability to distinguish between an enemy and a non-enemy.

The craziest part to me is that these colorbots can operate on a dual machine setup. There's a great diagram Niila drew describing the system, but it can make AI-powered colorbots virtually undetectable. The cheating is so subtle and doesn't read from a game's memory, so there isn't a lot game developers can do to protect from this.
